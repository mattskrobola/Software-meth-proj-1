# To Do List
So it looks like we did everything under the requirements but here's a few more things we should do before submitting

- Check the point deductions list to see what we shouldn't be doing
- Clean up the code and maybe add more comments
- Clean up the GUI

Other than that it looks like you really kicked this project's butt today
